// an add-on is an SKSE plugin showing its own bar beside Reticle Arcs' own. Reticle Arcs draws it in the player's look and
// asks the add-on for its state every frame; the add-on only reads the game. an add-on can also colour the built-in bars and
// read what they show. no CommonLib types cross it, so add-ons don't need the same CommonLib build. a crash inside an
// add-on's callback stops that add-on, not the game
